# AmazonStorefrontNode
A node amazon store where users can buy products
This is another node.js application using express and storing the data on MySQL database.  The user can switch between three node applications to run the first one shows the the products that are available from the store.  The user can enter the item number and buy as many of them that are available, if the user enters a value more then the quantity on hand for the product it will not allow it to go through same with entering a letter.  If there is not enough of one of the products or some of them are getting low, the user can go ahead and add more to the quantity of that product/products they can also add a brand new product if the wish or look at the products that have a quantity less then five.  Finally the user can return a table to the command terminal displaying the profit from the items that were sold and the overhead cost...  I really liked using and interacting with MySQL to me it gave the program a more real feel minus the front end part.  The only thing I have trouble with is the select statements because they can get complex.
